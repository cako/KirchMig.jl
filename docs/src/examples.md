## Layer Cake

[This notebook](https://github.com/cako/KirchMig.jl/blob/master/notebooks/LayerCake.ipynb) (or its associated [script](https://github.com/cako/KirchMig.jl/blob/master/notebooks/LayerCake.jl)) is a good starting point. It shows basic functionality of all steps of Kirchhoff inversion: traveltime computations, Kirchhoff mapping and inversion by conjugate gradients.

## Layer Cake: Regularization

[This notebook](https://github.com/cako/KirchMig.jl/blob/master/notebooks/LayerCake-Regularized.ipynb) (or its associated [script](https://github.com/cako/KirchMig.jl/blob/master/notebooks/LayerCake-Regularized.jl)) has some more advanced functionality including regularing the inversion.
